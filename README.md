##Chamber1
This is the beginning of training. Chamber1 contains 34 program sets, Junit Test and a mini project. 
- [List of programs](#programs)
- [Junit Test](#junit)
- [Mini Project](#project)

**You will learn following things from this chamber:**
* Data Types
* Operators
* Control Flow
* Modularity - DRY Principle
* Unit Testing - JUnit Right-BICEP and CORRECT Boundary Conditions
* Objects, Classes, Class Variables, Instance Variables, Methods
* Constructors and Chaining
* Method Overloading

###Following is the list of programs
```
1.  Find what type of triangle can be formed with given lengths of edges.
2.  Convert a given decimal number to binary representation.
3.  Convert a given binary number to decimal representation.
4.  Rinse and repeat 2 and 3 with hex, decimal, octa and binary as inputs and outputs. All permutations.
5.  Convert an IP address into Integer and vice-versa.
6.  Compute all anagrams of give number.
7.  Find the largest anagram of a given number.
8.  Find the smallest anagram of a given number.
9.  Find the next largest anagram of a given number.
10. Reverse the digits of a given number. 
11. Sum of first n natural numbers.
12. Sum of the squares of first n natural numbers.
13. Sum of the cubes of first n natural numbers.
14. Sum of the first n powers of 2
15. Find first n prime numbers.
16. Find first n twin prime numbers.
17. Sum of first n prime numbers.
18. Sum of first n twin prime numbers.
19. Find the factorial of a given number.
20. Find the square root of a given number.
21. Find the cube root of a given number.
22. Write a Counter that returns the next number. The counter has a specified range and it cycles. That is if the counter’s range is 10 to 20, and the current value of the counter is 20, when you get the next number, it will be 10.
23. Find the max number that could be in put to problems 11 to 19. All possible primitive data types - byte, short, int, long.
24. Use a byte to store the features of a Car such as ABS, Rear-view Camera, Power Steering, Power windows, AC, FM Radio, CD Player, MP3 Player. For a given byte display the features of a Car.
25. Where can you use bitwise and bit shift operators? Find 10 unique problems and solve them.

### Mini project description

Create a Zippr Code. Zippr Code is a 8 character alphanumeric code. Zippr allows their users to create their own Zippr code or it will create one for them. In our project we will generate a code and not let the users specify one. There are several ways you could create this 8 char-alpha-num code. For our purposes we will make sure that it is easy for people to spell the zippr code over phone and also read it in print. Usability issues arise when codes of these sort actually have 0, o, O, i, I, L, l, 1 etc characters. So we will consider these "confusing characters" as invalid characters when we generate the code. Typically our use cases require inputing this Zippr code to retrived the full address including the geolocation (lat long). So this code needs to be designed to be efficient for faster lookups.

* Convert degrees, minutes and seconds to decimal degrees. Lat Long.
* Check if given two lat longs are same.
* Find “as the crow flies” distance between two zippr codes.
* For a given zippr code, show the address from a given directory of zipper codes.

###Junit

Junit is testing framework to develop unit testing to test another piece of code. Please click this [link](https://github.com/dilipptt/dilip-java-training/wiki/Junit-Test) to take a detail look on junit.
### Main purpose of junit testing
* Intention - Get the expected value in all the conditions.
* Isolation - Every test should be independent from every other test.
* Repeatability - Every test should be able to run over and over again and produce the same results.
